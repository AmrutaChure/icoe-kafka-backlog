# Kafka Platform Team – Planning Board

Welcome to the **Kafka Platform Team’s Board**! This is central place for planning, tracking, and delivering work using a **Quarterly Planning**. Here you'll find how we organize OKR, features, sprints, track progress, prioritize roadmap items, and use board views effectively.

## 📅 Quarterly Planning Structure

We follow a **Quarterly Cadence**:
- 📆 **Each year** is broken down into **quarters** (e.g., `QC_25w10`, `QC_25w22`, `QC_25w37`, `QC_25w49`).
- Each **quarter** contains **six 2-week sprints**.
- Sprint naming format:

```
QC_25w10.01 | 10/03 → 21/03
QC_25w10.02 | 10/03 → 21/03
QC_25w10.03 | 10/03 → 21/03
QC_25w10.04 | 10/03 → 21/03
QC_25w10.05 | 10/03 → 21/03
QC_25w10.06 | 10/03 → 21/03

```
