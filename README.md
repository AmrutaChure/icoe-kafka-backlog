# Kafka Platform Team – Planning Board

Welcome to the **Kafka Platform Team’s Board**! This is central place for planning, tracking, and delivering work using a **Quarterly Planning**. Here you'll find how we organize OKR, features, sprints, track progress, prioritize roadmap items, and use board views effectively.

## 📋 Quarterly Planning Structure

We follow a **Quarterly Cadence**:
- Each year is broken down into **quarters** (e.g., `QC_25w10`, `QC_25w22`, `QC_25w37`, `QC_25w49`).
- Each **quarter** contains **six 2-week sprints**.
- Sprint naming format:

```
25w10.01 | 10/03 → 21/03
25w10.02 | 10/03 → 21/03
25w10.03 | 10/03 → 21/03
25w10.04 | 10/03 → 21/03
25w10.05 | 10/03 → 21/03
25w10.06 | 10/03 → 21/03

```

## 🔄 Work management process & Work Item Lifecycle (Status Labels)

We follow a Kanban approach to manage our workload, with the following workflow:


| Status            | Meaning                                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🆕 `New`           | Just created; needs more details                                    |
| 🧠 `Backlog`       | Ideas, not yet refined                                              |
| 🔍 `In Discovery`  | Item is under expoloration or analysis                              |
| ✅ `Ready`         | Groomed and ready for sprint                                        |

## 🚀 Roadmap Priority Labels

We categorize roadmap items using **Priority Tags**:

| Label                | Meaning                                                                       |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------   |
| 📍 `Now`                  | Actively being worked on or prioritized in the current or next sprint.   |
| 🔜 `Near Term`            | Planned for the upcoming quarter.                                        |
| 🕒 `Later`                | Not prioritized yet but part of roadmap for this year or next cycle.     |
| 🌱 `Future`               | A good idea or concept — acknowledged but not on the active roadmap yet. |
| ❓  `No Roadmap Priority` | Not yet evaluated or not aligned with current roadmap priorities.        |
| 📦 `Delivered`            | Completed in a previous roadmap cycle                                    |
